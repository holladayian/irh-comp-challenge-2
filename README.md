https://holladayian.github.io/irh-comp-challenge-2/


## Project Overview

We were given a picture of a webpage that we were to redesign from scratch on our own. For this all we needed to do was create the HTML and CSS. We were also encouraged to make our page responsive.

## Rubric

* Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
* Site must be responsive
* Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: [initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. “cd-comp-challenge-2”)
* Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
Push your final work to github pages
